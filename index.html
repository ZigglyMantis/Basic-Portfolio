                Hi, I'm Zygimantas Macijauskas. 
                I'm a 21 year old college student currently learning how to code. 
                I was born in Lithuania and moved to Florida 7 years later.
                Graduating high school I moved to Georgia which is where I reside to this day. 
                Some of my favorite activities are; painting, playing video games, and snowboarding which I can't seem to do on the account of no snow.
                My favorite foods include; boiled beef tongue, and veal dumplings.
            </p>

                I don't really like talking too much about myself since I don't find anything of what I do to special.
                I'm just another guy trying to get through life in the least painful way that I can.
                It would appear to me that coding is not an easy route, but hey; I'm hard working, and I love me some computers so I guess it was time to learn.
                I was introduced to computers by my Godmother Jovita. I dont recall too much from my childhood in Lithuania, but what I do know is that she was great with computers.
                That probably had an impact on me as a Impressionably young boy, and ever since I decided to make it my mission to try to understand these stupidly smart machines.
                That's all I got for now. More to come soon!
